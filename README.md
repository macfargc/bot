Madfutters Development Bot - By Gordon


All you have to do is download the file as a zip, install node js from https://nodejs.org/en (the recommended version)
Then extract the files to a folder somewhere, update the config.js and update the event hanlder's directory location so that it works.


Then open cmd and use cd and dir to locate where u have put the folder with the files in.
Then run in cmd >>> npm install discord.js
Wait for it to run
Then to run the bot run node main.js (Or folderName/main.js)

Enjoy!
