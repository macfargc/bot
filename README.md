Madfutters Development Bot - By Gordon


Instructions:


1. Install node.js (google it)
2. Make a folder anywhere and call it whatever you want
3. Open a cmd terminal and navigate to that folder
4. run "npm install discord.js" and let it do its thing
5. Then drag and drop the "main.js" folder inside that folder u made (not the node modules one)
6. Create a folder called "events" and a folder called "commands" inside your main folder.
7. Inside your main folder drag and drop the config file and edit everything that already has a value including (token)
8. Drag and drop the "mf.js" file into the commands folder
9. Inside cmd now run "node main.js"
10. Now the bot should hopefully work, any problems dm on discord @ gordon0333
Enjoy!
